# The script will
* move HTC and Verizon apks to /system/app/backup
* install AOSP APKs for Browser, Calendar, Calculator, Email (see stock_aps directory)
* Reboot

# Before running this script
 * Make a Nandroid backup
 * Install the Sense ROM of your choice (I jump around between BAMF, CleanROM and RezROM)
 * Install a launcher and keyboard of your choice (I like Nova and SwiftKey X)
 * Connect the device to USB

If you have not done any of these steps do not use this script!

# Do NOT expect

* Stock status bar
* Stock dialogs
* Stock dialer or Phone or People app

# Ideas
* Make this script work on .zip files instead of a running phone
** Would require: testing!  First time setup may just not work.
** Choosing/Adding a launcher.
* Replace Dialer,Phone, and People.apks with stock APKs
